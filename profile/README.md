# LMNtal, a unifying language and model checking tools
LMNtal (pronounced "elemental") is a programming and modeling language based on hierarchical graph rewriting.
It was designed to be a substrate language of diverse computational models, especially those addressing concurrency, 
mobility and multiset rewriting, including (Colored) Petri Nets, Interaction Nets, the Pi-Calculus, Chemical Abstract Machines, 
Constraint Handling Rules, and Bigraphs. 

<!--

It features point-to-point links to represent connectivity,
membranes to represent hierarchy and locality, and
graphical view of programs and computation.

Our full-fledged implementation supports nondeterministic state-space search 
and LTL model checking as well as ordinary graph-rewriting execution, 
making it an expressive verification tool.

Various unique features have been integrated into LaViT (LMNtal Visual Tools), 
an integrated development environment of LMNtal, that supports graph visualizer and 
state-space visualizer that turns out to be very useful for understanding as well as debugging your models and programs.
